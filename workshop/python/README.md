ZeroVM Python workshop samples

The samples in this directory are numbered. Since each example is more complex
than the next, so it is advised that you try them in order.

In addition to the prepared samples, you can just execute Python code using
`python -c` in the following manner:

    $ zvsh --zvm-image=python.tar python -c "import sys; print sys.platform"
